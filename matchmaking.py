class MatchMaking:
    """
    Implementation of a matchmaking algorithm to create balanced teams based on
    a skill rating.

    On initialization an initial seed is performed. When calling the `optimize`
    function the algorithm to balance the teams is being run.

    Initial seed
    ------------
    As a first step, players are subdivided into skill tiers. The number of
    skill tiers is the same as the team size.
    The best player from the highest skill tier is matched with the worst
    player from the lowest skill tier. For the next team the second best and
    the second worst are chosen and so on. From the middle skill tiers random
    players are chosen.

    Balancing Algorithm
    -------------------
    The optimization tries to minimize the score. As a scoring function first
    the average skill ratings of all teams are calculated. The score is
    calculated from the maximum deviation a team has from the total average
    skill rating.
    In each iteration of the balancing algorithm two teams are chosen at
    random or the minimum and the maximum scoring teams based on the
    `min_max_pairing` flag). Single players are swapped between the two teams.
    After swapping the new score is calculated. If the swapping improves the
    overall score - the changes are kept.
    As stopping criteria either the number of iterations is used or the number
    of iterations without a change.
